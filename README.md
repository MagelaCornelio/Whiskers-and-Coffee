Welcome to the web application repository for **Whiskers & Coffee**. This project is being developed using Flutter to create a modern and attractive user experience for the coffee shop's customers.

## üìú Description

This web application primarily aims to serve as the coffee shop's online presence, providing essential information to current and potential customers. It includes details about the menu, location, hours, the coffee shop's story, and contact information.

    *   **Menu Highlights:** Section with visual cards (`Card`) showcasing some star products (using `Wrap` for basic adaptability)

## üöÄ Planned Features / Next Steps

*   Full development of the remaining pages:
    *   **Menu:** Detailed list of all products with descriptions and prices.
    *   **About Us:** Expanded page with the story, philosophy, and perhaps the team.
